Robin had 2 brothers.  She also had one sister.  During this time, Robin grew and grew and got stronger and stronger.  Her feathers got longer, too.  \\newline\\newlineThe day had finally come when mother bird told Robin and her brothers and sister that they would be learning to fly for the first time.  Chirps of joy were heard from all the baby birds.  All except for Robin.  She was too afraid to fly out into the world.  She wanted to stay in her comfy nest with all of her family for the rest of her life.  She also wanted her mother to feed her for the rest of her life. Mother bird told Robin how exciting it was to fly and see all the beautiful flowers and trees and told her she would help her learn like she did when she was a baby bird. She told her that she would meet lots of other bird friends, too. \\newline\\newlineSo Robin tried not to be scared, even as she saw both of her brothers and sister fly off the nest and out into the world.  They looked so happy.  Then it was her turn.  She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.  Oh happy day!  It was everything her mother said it would be.  The world looked so big and Robin couldn't wait to see it all.",

Robin had 2 brothers.  She also had one sister.  During this time, Robin grew and grew and got stronger and stronger.  Her feathers got longer, too.  \\newline\\newlineThe day had finally come when mother bird told Robin and her brothers and sister that they would be learning to fly for the first time.  Chirps of joy were heard from all the baby birds.  All except for Robin.  She was too afraid to fly out into the world.  She wanted to stay in her comfy nest with all of her family for the rest of her life.  She also wanted her mother to feed her for the rest of her life. Mother bird told Robin how exciting it was to fly and see all the beautiful flowers and trees and told her she would help her learn like she did when she was a baby bird. She told her that she would meet lots of other bird friends, too. \\newline\\newlineSo Robin tried not to be scared, even as she saw both of her brothers and sister fly off the nest and out into the world.  They looked so happy.  Then it was her turn.  She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.  Oh happy day!  It was everything her mother said it would be.  The world looked so big and Robin couldn't wait to see it all.",

Her feathers got longer, too.  \\newline\\newlineThe day had finally come when mother bird told Robin and her brothers and sister that they would be learning to fly for the first time.  Chirps of joy were heard from all the baby birds.  All except for Robin.  She was too afraid to fly out into the world.  She wanted to stay in her comfy nest with all of her family for the rest of her life.  She also wanted her mother to feed her for the rest of her life. Mother bird told Robin how exciting it was to fly and see all the beautiful flowers and trees and told her she would help her learn like she did when she was a baby bird. She told her that she would meet lots of other bird friends, too. \\newline\\newlineSo Robin tried not to be scared, even as she saw both of her brothers and sister fly off the nest and out into the world.  They looked so happy.  Then it was her turn.  She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.  Oh happy day!  It was everything her mother said it would be.  The world looked so big and Robin couldn't wait to see it all.",

In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends.",

Jack put too much chicken in Noodle's bowl. Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor Noodle! Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick. Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play. Polly stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. Puff found a little red ladybug. Fluff found a big gray mouse. Noodle found a long brown stick. Jack found a deep pond with three ducks in it. Everyone had a great day at the park. Then the three dogs and Jack all went back home. When they got home, Polly was asleep on the bed. Polly said she was feeling better. Jack brought Polly some chicken noodle soup to eat.

In 1997, the 15-year-old boy studied at a famous American music college.\nLang's performances are energetic. He is well-known for making facial  expressions and moving around while playing the piano.\nThe road to success has never been easy. Lang's father stopped his job to look after him, while his mother stayed in Shenyang to make money. But Lang thinks himself lucky and believes he should give something back.

        "While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. \"Can we get ice cream, Nana?\" asked Tina. \"Sure we can!\" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. \"Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!\" Laughing at what was said, I answered, \"If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!\" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. \"Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?\" she asked. \"If that is what you want, you sure can!\" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. \"Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?\" \"Let's go!\" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. \"That is okay\", she said, \"Butterflies need to be left out to fly free\".  Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.",

Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.\\newline\\newlineMy mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie.

They went out to the pond and on the way they saw a frog.  They also saw a boat in the water.  They saw a water lily. They looked in the water until they saw the mother duck and her ducklings.  They were different colors.  Six of them were brown and yellow. Four of them were only yellow.  Two ducklings were brown.  There was one that was white. They were all very fuzzy.  \\newlineThey went back to the house to tell Auntie Beth about the ducklings.  She was cooking on the stove.  She asked Sue to get some eggs.  She asked David to get some butter. Auntie Beth poured some milk into a bowl of flour. She made them a cake.  \"I'm so glad you've come to visit me,\" Auntie Beth said.  Sue told her about the things they saw at the pond.  David said, \"We saw a frog.  Don't forget the frog. It was my favorite.\"  It was a good visit.",

        "A predator  kills and eats other animals as prey .Sometimes it also becomes food for other predators. Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass.\nSome predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey.\nSome people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator. They not only hunt for food. They also hunt for fun. They kill sharks for their fins, and tigers for skins. Those human hunters are the worst predators on Earth.",

It came out in 1952. The main character in the book is a fisherman. He is an old man and fishes alone. People think he is a man with bad luck, because he doesn't get a fish in eighty-four days.

Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends.",

Scientists are studying how they live and more baby pandas are born in the zoos.\nPandas live in the forests and mountains of Southern China. They mainly live on bamboo, and each pandas needs to eat a lot of bamboo every day. The area of bamboo is becoming smaller for many different reasons, so pandas have less and less land to live on. Pandas don't have many babies, and baby panda often dies. The situation is becoming very serious.\nOur government is working hard to save pandas. There are more than 30 nature reserves to protect pandas but these are not enough. The government has made a new plan to help pandas. The nature reserves will be bigger and the bamboo will grow better. Then the pandas will have enough food and enough places to live in. Pandas born in the zoos may go back to live in the nature reserves.\nMost people love pandas. The panda is one of the best-known animals in the world. It is the symbol for the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF works to protect all animals in danger, so the panda has become the symbol of all animals in danger. There is still a long way to save the panda. Think of other animals in danger. There is still a long way to go to save the panda.

        "There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"\\newline\\newline\"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"\\newline\\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\\newline\\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \\newline\\newline\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\\newline\\newline\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.\"\\newline\\newline\"No problem,\" said Twinkles. \"That's what friends are for.\"",

        "This story takes place in a faraway land.  One day, in this magical kingdom a happy little kitten, named Lucy, was walking down the road.  As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.  The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.  The frog said, \"Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock.\"  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.",

He originally received a <hl> B– <hl> for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959. According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project. Both the 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time ever at Fort McHenry on Independence Day one year apart, 1959 and 1960 respectively.",

        "What do Napoleon, Clinton and Wang Nan have in common? They are all left-handed. Today about 15% of the people are left-handed. But why are people left-handed? The answer is the way the brain   works. The brain has two halves---the right half and the left half. The right half controls   the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. So right-handed people have a strong left brain, and the left -handed people have a strong right brain.\nThe two halves of the brain are about the same size. But each side controls different things. The left side controls language, Maths and logic  . When you remember new words, or when you put things in order, you use your left side.\nThe right side of the brain controls colour and music. It is also good at recognizing   faces. This does not mean that all artists are left-handed and all accountants   are right-handed. Some right-handers have a strong right brain, and some left-handers have a strong left brain.",

When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog.\"\\newline\\newlineJamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. \\newline\\newline\"This dog is pretty big, Jamey,\" his father said. \"He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have.\"  \\newline\\newlineJamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.\\newline\\newline\"This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?\"\\newline\\newlineJamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.\\newline\\newline\"Do you like the brown dog?\" asked Jamey's dad.\\newline\\newline\"Yes!\" said Jamey. \"Can we get him?\"\\newline\\newline\"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?\" asked Jamey's mom.\\newline\\newline\"I promise,\" said Jamey.\\newline\\newline\"In that case, I guess we have a dog!\"\\newline\\newlineThis made Jamey very happy.",

One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

One day he made a plan to play a joke. \\newline\\newlineHe took a cookie and with it in his hand went to dig a hole under the old lady's shoe. When he finished digging he hid the cookie in the hole and then went to the zoo. He stole a bunch of monkeys which he took back to the lady's shoe house. The TV news team was talking to her on camera that day outside her house about how great she was for living in a shoe and how smart and cool she was. \\newline\\newlineThe guy stood there listening with his bag of hungry monkeys. At the very second the news team took a close up of the shoe with their big camera the guy opened the bag and freed the monkeys. He had told them earlier that hidden somewhere in the house was a cookie. He laughed very loud as he imagined them tearing up her house on live TV. But instead of doing that, they stood around looking bored because monkeys like bananas not cookies.",
